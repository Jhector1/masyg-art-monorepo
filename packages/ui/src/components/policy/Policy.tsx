      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">Last updated: September 10, 2025</p>

      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>ZileDigital</strong> (“ZileDigital”, “we”, “us”). By
        accessing, creating an account, purchasing, downloading, or otherwise
        using our website, studio tools, or services (collectively, the
        “Platform”), you agree to these Terms of Use and any referenced
        policies. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.
      </p>

      <h2>1) About the Platform</h2>
      <p>
        ZileDigital is an online store for digital artwork, customizable design
        assets, and made-to-order prints. You may browse as a guest or create an
        account. Some features—like saving custom designs, purchases, and
        downloads—require a user account or a guest ID cookie.
      </p>

      <h2>2) Accounts & Access</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Platform.</li>
        <li>
          You are responsible for your account credentials and any activity under
          your account or guest session.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may offer sign-in via email/password or third-party providers (e.g.,
          Google). Third-party logins are subject to their own terms.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may limit, suspend, or terminate access for suspected violations of
          these Terms or illegal activity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Studio Tools, Custom Designs & Exports</h2>
      <p>
        Our “Zile Studio” lets you customize supported artworks (e.g., colors,
        gradients, strokes, backgrounds) and export raster formats (e.g., PNG,
        JPG, WebP, TIFF). Your ability to export may be governed by purchased
        entitlements or license tiers. We may watermark preview images and
        restrict export sizes or counts to prevent abuse.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Design Snapshots:</strong> A snapshot of your design may be
          saved at purchase time for entitlement verification and download
          fulfillment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Export/Download Tokens:</strong> Download links or ZIP files
          may be tokenized and time-limited. Tokens can be revoked in cases of
          suspected abuse or chargeback.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DRM/Deterrents:</strong> We may use techniques like watermarking,
          path obfuscation, or canvas-based viewing for anti-piracy deterrence.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Digital Products & License Grant</h2>
      <p>
        When you purchase a digital product, you receive a license—not ownership
        of the underlying intellectual property. License scope depends on the
        option you select at checkout (e.g., Personal, Commercial, Extended).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal:</strong> Use in personal, non-commercial projects.
          No resale, sublicensing, or redistribution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commercial:</strong> Use in commercial projects for you/your
          organization. No resale or redistribution of source files or the work
          “as is” as a competing asset.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Extended:</strong> Higher-volume or broader commercial use
          (details shown at checkout). Still prohibits resale or redistribution
          of source files as stock/clipart/templates.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Unless expressly permitted in your license: (a) you may not resell,
        redistribute, share, or sublicense the digital files; (b) you may not
        claim authorship of the original artwork; (c) you may not use the
        artwork to train AI models or generate derivative datasets; (d) you may
        not mint NFTs or similar tokens of the artwork; (e) you may not use the
        artwork in defamatory, hateful, or unlawful contexts.
      </p>

      <h2>5) Print Products (Made-to-Order)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Prints are produced on demand based on your selected options (size,
          format, material, frame). Review your configuration carefully prior to
          checkout.
        </li>
        <li>
          Minor color/trim variations can occur due to device screens and print
          processes. These are not considered defects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shipping timelines are estimates and may vary by destination.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        All artworks, designs, code, and content on the Platform are protected
        by intellectual property laws and remain the property of ZileDigital or
        their respective owners. Except for the license expressly granted to
        you, no rights are transferred. Unauthorized use is prohibited.
      </p>

      <h2>7) Acceptable Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No scraping, bulk downloading, or circumvention of security.</li>
        <li>No reverse engineering, decompiling, or exploiting vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>No infringing, unlawful, or harmful activities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8) Payments, Taxes & Fraud</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Payments are processed by third parties (e.g., Stripe).</li>
        <li>
          You authorize us and our payment processor to charge your selected
          payment method for your order total, including taxes and shipping (if
          applicable).
        </li>
        <li>
          We may cancel or refuse orders for suspected fraud, abuse, or pricing
          errors.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9) Refunds & Replacements</h2>
      <p>
        See our <a href="/legal/refunds">Refund Policy</a> for details on
        digital sales (generally final) and damaged/defective prints.
      </p>

      <h2>10) Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        The Platform is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the maximum
        extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties and will not be
        liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages
        arising from your use of the Platform. Some jurisdictions do not allow
        certain limitations; your rights may vary.
      </p>

      <h2>11) Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be
        posted on this page with a new “Last updated” date. Continued use
        indicates acceptance of the updated Terms.

      <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">Last updated: September 10, 2025</p>

      <h2>Digital Products</h2>
      <p>
        All digital sales are final. Because digital files are accessible
        immediately and can be copied, we do not offer refunds after a download
        or export has occurred. If you experience technical issues (e.g., a
        corrupted or missing file, download link problems), contact us and we’ll
        assist with re-delivery.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We may issue a courtesy replacement link at our discretion.</li>
        <li>
          Download links and ZIP packages may be tokenized and time-limited.
        </li>
        <li>
          Abuse (excessive downloads, token sharing) may result in link
          revocation without refund.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Print Products (Made-to-Order)</h2>
      <p>
        We’ll replace or credit prints that arrive damaged or have a clear
        manufacturing defect. Please contact us within <strong>7 days</strong> of
        delivery with photos of the packaging and item.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Because prints are customized and made-to-order, we do not accept
          exchanges or returns for size, format, or preference changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Minor color/trim differences are normal and not considered defects.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a package is lost or stolen after carrier delivery confirmation,
          we’ll work with you case-by-case but cannot guarantee refunds.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Order Changes & Cancellations</h2>
      <p>
        Orders begin processing quickly. If you need to cancel or change a print
        order, contact us immediately; we can’t guarantee changes after
        production begins.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Reach Us</h2>
      <p>
